# Full Stack Application - F1

This project consists of a Python backend and a TypeScript/HTML frontend, each located in their respective folders.

## Running the Application

Use Docker Compose to build and run the application:

```
docker compose up --build
```
And to tear it down:

```
docker compose down -v
```

Always use Incognito Mode when testing the frontend in your browser.
Browsers cache compiled frontend code aggressively, which can lead to outdated behavior during development.
